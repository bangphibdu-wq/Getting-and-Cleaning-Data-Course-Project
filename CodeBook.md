## Data Source
The data is derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" which captures measurements from accelerometers and gyroscopes of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones worn by 30 subjects performing 6 activities.

## Transformations
1. Merged the training and test datasets.
2. Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Replaced activity codes with descriptive activity names (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).
4. Labelled columns with descriptive variable names (e.g., replaced Acc with Accelerometer, Gyro with Gyroscope, t with Time, f with Frequency).
5. Created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Variables
- subject: ID of the participant (1 to 30)
- activity: Type of activity performed (Factor with 6 levels)
- [Other 86 columns]: Average values of the mean and standard deviation measurements (numeric values normalized and bounded within [-1,1]).
